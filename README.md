# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. 
The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

You will be required to submit: 
1. a tidy data set as described below, 
2. a link to a Github repository with your script for performing the analysis, 
3. a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed 
   to clean up the data called CodeBook.md. You should also include a README.md in the repo with your scripts. 
   This repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected.

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this 
article. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to 
attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers 
from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:

## Content of the repo

* CodeBook.md
* README.md
* run_analysis.R

## What to do

1. You should download the data and unzip them into working directory.
2. Source the script run_analysis.R to run and create tidy data set.
3. Tidy data set will be written in UCI HAR Dataset directory.
